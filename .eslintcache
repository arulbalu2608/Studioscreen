This enormous amount of passion in\r\n                    photography in me has lead me to take up photography as not\r\n                    only passion but also my career. Despite after all those\r\n                    mocking as, “you could have the high chances of being paid\r\n                    low”, “what could you be leading by taking up this as a\r\n                    career?” from my families and closed circle of people, I\r\n                    really found myself into the passion of photography and\r\n                    nevertheless my involvement in it has decreased since the\r\n                    start. Not just with the passion, anything could be\r\n                    achieved. I got myself trained with many of the well-known\r\n                    photographers who has got their experiences well and good in\r\n                    this field. And so, now I have got myself into the\r\n                    profession with the passion and the trained skills.\r\n                    Accompanied with these skills as a professional, I have\r\n                    really got the goodwill of numerous customers. With the\r\n                    blessings and the unimaginable support of my loveable\r\n                    family, relatives, friends and customers, I hope for more\r\n                    and more improvement in my career. I strongly believe in the\r\n                    fact, “Quality is never an act, but always a habit” and so\r\n                    all of my customers can expect it being reflected in all my\r\n                    works\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    <strong>Because every picture has story to tell</strong>\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </Fade>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"col-sm-6 col-md-6\">\r\n              <div className=\"about-owner\">\r\n                <Flip>\r\n                  <img\r\n                    src={img}\r\n                    className=\"img-fluid img-responsive imgs\"\r\n                    width=\"300px\"\r\n                    alt=\"Responsive image\"\r\n                  />\r\n                </Flip>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AboutUs;\r\n","F:\\React\\studioscreen\\src\\comp\\footer\\Footer.js",["37","38","39","40","41","42","43"],{"ruleId":"44","replacedBy":"45"},{"ruleId":"46","replacedBy":"47"},{"ruleId":"48","severity":1,"message":"49","line":4,"column":16,"nodeType":"50","messageId":"51","endLine":4,"endColumn":20},{"ruleId":"52","severity":1,"message":"53","line":24,"column":17,"nodeType":"54","endLine":29,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"52","severity":1,"message":"53","line":100,"column":19,"nodeType":"54","endLine":105,"endColumn":21},{"ruleId":"48","severity":1,"message":"49","line":2,"column":16,"nodeType":"50","messageId":"51","endLine":2,"endColumn":20},{"ruleId":"55","severity":1,"message":"56","line":40,"column":17,"nodeType":"54","endLine":40,"endColumn":48},{"ruleId":"57","severity":1,"message":"58","line":51,"column":15,"nodeType":"54","endLine":57,"endColumn":33},{"ruleId":"55","severity":1,"message":"56","line":62,"column":11,"nodeType":"54","endLine":62,"endColumn":48},{"ruleId":"55","severity":1,"message":"56","line":65,"column":11,"nodeType":"54","endLine":65,"endColumn":48},{"ruleId":"55","severity":1,"message":"56","line":68,"column":11,"nodeType":"54","endLine":68,"endColumn":48},{"ruleId":"55","severity":1,"message":"56","line":76,"column":13,"nodeType":"54","endLine":76,"endColumn":44},"no-native-reassign",["59"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["60"],"no-unused-vars","'Text' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt","Redundant alt attribute.
